# Flask Application: The Flask application is initiated to renders an HTML form for user data collection. Upon submission, the data is captured and stored in a MongoDB database. 

# User Class and CSV Export: A User class such as age, gender, total income, and expenses was defined. The save_to_csv function takes a list of User objects and exports their data to a CSV file using the Pandas library. 

# Data Visualization: In a Jupyter notebook, the CSV file is loaded, and two visualizations are created using Matplotlib. The first visualization displays the relationship between age and total income, while the second illustrates the gender distribution across various spending categories.
